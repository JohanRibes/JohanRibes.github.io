* Lecture 1: Goals of the course; what is computation; introduction to data types, operators, and variables
* Instructors: Prof. Eric Grimson, Prof. John Guttag.

### Notes 
Program is a recipe.
Build a description of the recipe, **on a sequence of primitive instructions**.
To describe the recipe we do want a language.

### Interpreted != Compiled

#### Interpreted
Control the flow that is going through the instructions and give you an ouptut.

#### Compiled
Intermediate step, create object code.
It helps catch bugs and convert it into more efficient sequence of instructions.

### Syntax vs. Semantic
* Syntax: What words are legal expressions.
* Static Semantic: Combination of legal expressions.
* Semantics: What does the program. What happens on the screen. 

### Python
* Values: Numbers (int, float), Strings.
* Operators: +, -, /, *, **.
* Variable: Contains value(s).
Shell testing, showing syntax errors, ands static semantic errors.
